Welcome to Bugtracks!

Bugtracks is a very simple bug tracking system designed to work inside a repository.  It keeps track of issues, but leaves permissions, attribution, history, and data verification to the repository.

Bugtracks is written as a desktop application, and can be compiled for Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows.

Currently, the program is not written yet.  Hopefully, that will change soon.
